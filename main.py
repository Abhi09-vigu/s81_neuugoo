# --- Video Explanation ---
# Stop sequence in LLMs is a special string that tells the model when to stop generating further output.
# It helps control the length and format of responses, ensuring the output ends at a desired point.
# In this code, "<END>" is used as a stop sequence, so the model stops generating text when it encounters this string.
# This is useful for structured outputs and prevents unwanted trailing text.
