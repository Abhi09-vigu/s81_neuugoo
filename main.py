# --- Video Explanation ---
# One-shot prompting means providing the AI with a single example to guide its response.
# In this code, the prompt includes one sample evaluation in JSON format.
# This helps the model understand the expected structure and style for its own output.
# One-shot prompting is useful when you want the model to mimic a specific format or approach, but don't
