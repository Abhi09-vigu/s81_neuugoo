# --- Video Explanation ---
# Structured output in LLMs means instructing the model to return its response in a specific format, such as JSON.
# This makes it easier to parse, validate, and use the output programmatically.
# In this code, the prompt asks the AI to return its evaluation as a JSON object with defined fields.
# The code then attempts to parse the response as JSON, demonstrating structured output in action.
