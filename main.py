# --- Video Explanation ---
# Embeddings in LLMs are high-dimensional numerical representations of text.
# They capture the semantic meaning of words, sentences, or documents, allowing models to compare and analyze text efficiently.
# Embeddings are computed by passing text through a neural network, resulting in a vector.
# Practical applications include semantic search, clustering, recommendation systems, and measuring text similarity.
# In this code, we generate an embedding for a sample sentence, which can be used for these tasks.
