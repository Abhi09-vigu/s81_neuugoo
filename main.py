# Chain of thought prompting: ask the model to reason step by step

def build_prompt(api_response, criteria):

You are an API evaluator. Given the following API response and evaluation criteria, assess the APIâ€™s performance.

API Response:
{api_response}

Evaluation Criteria:
{criteria}

Think step by step. First, analyze the API response for correctness. Next, evaluate its efficiency. Then, consider scalability. After reasoning through each criterion, summarize your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "correctness": "<your assessment>",
  "efficiency": "<your assessment>",
  "scalability": "<your assessment>"
}}
<END>

criteria = """
- Correctness: Does it return the correct data based on the provided request?
- Efficiency: How quickly and efficiently does it fetch the data?
- Scalability: Can the API handle increased traffic and large data sets without performance degradation?

# --- Video Explanation ---
# Chain of thought prompting means instructing the AI to reason step by step before giving a final answer.
# In this code, the prompt asks the model to analyze correctness, efficiency, and scalability one by one, then summarize its findings in a structured JSON output.
# This approach helps the model produce more accurate, logical, and transparent responses by making its reasoning process
