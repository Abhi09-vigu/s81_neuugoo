# --- Video Explanation ---
# Tokens are chunks of text (words or parts of words) that AI models use to process and generate language.
# Each prompt and response is broken down into tokens, and the number of tokens affects cost and performance.
# In this code, after every AI call, the number of tokens used is logged to the console for transparency.
